Steeriously. A dead-\/simple pure C++ library for adding steering behaviors to your game and multimedia entities. \par
All credit goes to Mat Buckland for writing \char`\"{}\-Programming A\-I by Example\char`\"{} and providing such great steering code. \par
All source is derived from \char`\"{}\-Programming A\-I by Example\char`\"{}.\par

 \par
Steeriously has one humble goal -\/ to make steering behavior accessible and fun to program. \par
One way to achieve this is by redesigning the original code to expose a more general purpose A\-P\-I. \par
