\section{Namespace List}
Here is a list of all documented namespaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{namespacesteer}{steer} \\*All steering functions are templated for easy application to objects inheriting from \hyperlink{classsteer_1_1_agent}{Agent}. Because of this, it is easy to add into any type of design -\/ be it a class hierarchy or a more advanced data structure or system (such as an entity component system). All functions return a steer\-::steer\-::\-Vector2 that can be used to calculate a force with which the entity should be moved given each type of behavior. Combine each calculated force with a weight (any scalar value -\/ but keep it sane or behavior could become strange). Simply multiply each weight, or weights, by the force generated by each behavior's return value to fine-\/tune it. In addition to the steering functions themselves, this file contains various utilities used by them to perform their work }{\pageref{namespacesteer}}{}
